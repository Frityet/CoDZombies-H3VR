# Nacht der Untoten

Welcome to the call of duty zombies inspired mod. It is not only a map, but also
a gamemode, in which you'll be fighting to survive through waves of zombies.
Features including:
- Zosigs or Custom enemies
- Wave system
- Limited ammo mode
- Power ups
- Perks
- Buying weapons
- Mystery Box
- Pack A Punch
- Barricading windows
- Rayguns by Sora101Ven

Important:
- Buying stuff, changing settings etc. are done by pulling the levers

### How to play?
When you launch the game, turn 180 degrees to see and select the custom map. Then load it like any other scene.
If you can't see it, or it loads proving grounds, then 90% chances are, you've done something wrong, or there is a problem with other mods.
